# Initialize the counter variable
number = 6

# While loop that continues as long as number is greater than 0
# This creates a countdown from 6 to 1
while number > 0:
    print(number)    # Print current number
    number -= 1      # Decrement number by 1 (same as number = number - 1)
    # Loop continues until number becomes 0
