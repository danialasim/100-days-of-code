# Day 23 - The Turtle Crossing Capstone Project

## Game Overview
Turtle Crossing is an arcade-style game where the player controls a turtle that must cross a busy road while avoiding moving cars. The game gets progressively harder as the player advances through levels.

## Components

### 1. Main Game (`day_23_turtle_crossing_main.py`)
- Game initialization and setup
- Main game loop
- Collision detection
- Level progression
- Game over handling

### 2. Player (`day_23_turtle_crossing_player.py`)
- Turtle player movement
- Starting position management
- Level completion detection
- Movement constraints

### 3. Car Manager (`day_23_car_manager.py`)
- Car creation and movement
- Speed management
- Random car generation
- Car color randomization

### 4. Scoreboard (`day_23_turtle_crossing_scoreboard.py`)
- Level tracking and display
- Game over message
- Score updates

## Game Features

### 1. Player Controls
- Up arrow: Move forward
- Player can only move forward (no backward/sideways movement)
- Player resets position after reaching the finish line

### 2. Car Mechanics
- Cars move from right to left
- Random car generation with varying colors
- Car speed increases with each level
- Cars are generated at random y-positions

### 3. Game Mechanics
- Level increases when player reaches the top
- Game over when player collides with a car
- Cars speed up after each successful crossing
- Player must time movements carefully

### 4. Visual Elements
- Colorful cars
- Clear level display
- Game over screen
- Simple but effective graphics

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Object-Oriented Design
- Separate classes for different game components
- Clean separation of concerns
- Encapsulated functionality
- Inheritance from Turtle class

### 2. Game Physics
- Movement constraints
- Collision detection
- Speed management
- Screen boundary checking

### 3. Event Handling
- Keyboard input
- Game state management
- Level progression
- Game over conditions

### 4. Game Loop
- Continuous car generation
- Movement updates
- Collision checks
- Screen refresh
