# Day 24 - Files, Directories, and Paths

## Project Overview
This project focuses on file handling in Python and enhancing the Snake game with file persistence. It demonstrates working with files, managing high scores, and understanding file paths.

## Components

### 1. File Handling Basics (`day_24_read_write.py`)
- Basic file operations
- Reading and writing text files
- File modes and contexts
- Error handling

### 2. Enhanced Snake Game
The Snake game has been improved with persistent high score functionality:

#### Main Game (`day_24_snake_game_with_highest_score.py`)
- Enhanced game mechanics
- High score tracking
- File-based score persistence
- Game state management

#### Snake Functions (`day_24_snake_function.py`)
- Core snake movement
- Body segment management
- Collision detection
- Snake growth mechanics

#### Food System (`day_24_snake_food.py`)
- Food spawning logic
- Random positioning
- Collision detection with snake

#### Scoreboard (`day_24_snake_scoreboard.py`)
- Score display
- High score tracking
- File-based persistence
- Game over handling

## Technical Implementation

### 1. File Operations
```python
# Reading from file
with open("filename.txt") as file:
    content = file.read()

# Writing to file
with open("filename.txt", mode="w") as file:
    file.write("New content")
```

### 2. File Paths
- Absolute vs. Relative paths
- Path manipulation
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Directory navigation

### 3. High Score System
- Score persistence between sessions
- File-based storage
- Error handling for file operations
- Score comparison and updates

### 4. Enhanced Game Features
- Persistent high score display
- Score file management
- Improved game over handling
- Reset functionality

## Key Concepts Learned

1. File Handling
   - File modes (read, write, append)
   - Context managers (with statement)
   - Error handling for file operations
   - File paths and directories

2. Data Persistence
   - Saving game state
   - Loading saved data
   - Managing high scores
   - File-based storage strategies

3. Path Management
   - Understanding file paths
   - Working with directories
   - Cross-platform compatibility
   - Path manipulation techniques

4. Error Handling
   - File not found scenarios
   - Permission issues
   - Data validation
   - Graceful error recovery
