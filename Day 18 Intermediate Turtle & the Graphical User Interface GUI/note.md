# Day 18 - Turtle Graphics & GUI Programming

## Concepts Learned
1. **Turtle Graphics Basics**
   - Creating turtle objects
   - Basic movements (forward, backward, right, left)
   - Pen control (up, down, color)
   - Screen setup and control

2. **Python Module Import Methods**
   - Direct import (`import turtle`)
   - From import (`from turtle import Turtle`)
   - Aliasing (`import turtle as t`)
   - Selective import (`from turtle import Turtle, Screen`)

3. **Advanced Turtle Graphics**
   - Drawing shapes
   - Random colors
   - Spirograph patterns
   - Random walks
   - Event handling

4. **Color Theory in Python**
   - RGB colors
   - Named colors
   - Color mode settings
   - Random color generation

## Code Files Explained

### 1. Basic Turtle Graphics (`day_18_turtle_graphic.py`)
```python
# Demonstrates basic turtle movements and multiple turtle objects
# Features:
# - Drawing squares
# - Multiple turtle instances
# - Dashed line drawing
```

### 2. Different Shapes (`day_18_turtle_different_shapes.py`)
```python
# Creates various geometric shapes with different colors
# Features:
# - Function to draw shapes with n sides
# - Random color selection
# - Shapes from triangle to decagon
```

### 3. Random Walk (`day_18_turtle_random_walk.py`)
```python
# Implements a random walk algorithm
# Features:
# - Random RGB colors
# - Random direction selection
# - Custom line thickness
```

### 4. Spirograph (`day_18_turtle_spirograph.py`)
```python
# Creates a spirograph pattern
# Features:
# - Circular patterns
# - Random colors
# - Adjustable gap size
```

### 5. Import Methods (`day_18_importing_models_aliases.py`)
```python
# Demonstrates different ways to import modules
# Shows:
# - Direct import
# - From import
# - Import with alias
# - Wildcard import (not recommended)
```

### 6. Hirst Painting Project (`day_18_hirst_painting.py`)
```python
# Creates a dot painting in the style of Damien Hirst
# Features:
# - Color extraction from image
# - Dot pattern creation
# - Turtle movement control
```

## Key Concepts Explained

### Turtle Movement
- `forward(distance)`: Move forward
- `backward(distance)`: Move backward
- `right(angle)`: Turn right
- `left(angle)`: Turn left
- `setheading(angle)`: Set absolute direction

### Pen Control
- `penup()`: Stop drawing
- `pendown()`: Start drawing
- `pensize(width)`: Set line thickness
- `color(color)`: Set pen color

### Screen Control
- `screen = Screen()`: Create screen
- `screen.exitonclick()`: Keep window open
- `screen.colormode(255)`: Set RGB color mode

### Color Handling
- Named colors: "red", "blue", etc.
- RGB tuples: (255, 0, 0)
- Random colors: `random.choice(colors)`
- Random RGB: `random.randint(0, 255)`

## Project Highlights

### 1. Shape Drawing
- Function to calculate angles
- Dynamic side length
- Color variation

### 2. Random Walk
- Direction control
- Speed settings
- Line customization

### 3. Spirograph
