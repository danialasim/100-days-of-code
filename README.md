# 100 Days of Code: Python and Beyond 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** repository! This repository tracks my progress as I take on the challenge of coding daily for 100 days, following Dr. Angela Yu's comprehensive Python course.

## 📅 Daily Progress  

Each day, I’ll:  
- Learn a new concept or improve existing skills.  
- Solve coding challenges to reinforce the concepts.  
- Build small to medium-sized projects to apply what I’ve learned.  
- Document my journey and key takeaways.
